Project Report in Brief:


1.  Use Jupyter Notebook 3 to run source code.

2.  Upload the Imdb movie dataset in jupyter Notebook after pooling the data from GitHub. 

3.  After Data preprocessing and Splitting the data in 80:20 ratio model fitting has been done.

4.  I run four classifiers after Tuning the parameter using GridSearchCV to best parameter combination.  
 
5.  Obtained 67% average accuracy from RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoost and MLP classifier.

6.  Confusion matrix has been obtained for every classifier.  

7.  Source code has been provided in .ipynb file
